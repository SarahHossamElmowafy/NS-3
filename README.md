# NS-3

Designing a network topology which consists of below parts:

1. Point-to-Point part
This part consists of two nodes (P2P always has 2 nodes) which are connected by P2P topology with rate of 
10Mbps and delay of 2ms.
2. LAN1
This part consists of 4 nodes which are connected through CSMA topology with data rate of 100Mbps and 
delay of 50ms. Node n1 from P2P part is also a part of LAN1. So, you need to define 3 extra nodes for this 
part of the network.
3. LAN2
This part consists of 5 nodes which are connected through CSMA topology with data rate of 200Mbps and 
delay of 20ms. Node n0 from P2P part is also a part of LAN2. So, you need to define 4 extra nodes for this 
part of the network.
